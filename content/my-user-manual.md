# Running the play

Download the starter deck and review what questions you'd like to ask of yourself and of your teammates. Agree on which ones to focus on.

## Step 1

### Spend time before you meet answering each of the prompts (30 mins)

We've provided 10 prompts in the deck, but here's a sample of what you'll find:

* Conditions I like to work in
* Best ways to communicate with me
* The ways I like to receive feedback
* Things I love
* Favorite saying

## Step 2

### Share your user manuals with each other (5 - 60 mins)

{{% callout `Timing` %}} (Number of Participants - 1) x 7 minutes

A good estimate for timing is to take the number of participants, subtract 1, then multiply by 7 to get the number of participants. So if you have 8 participants, it would be (8-1) x 7 = 49 minutes. {{% /callout %}}

Pair up into teams of 2 (with one team of 3 if you have an odd number of team members), and take turns sharing feedback on areas such as:

* How you partner’s description of themselves matches up with your experience working with them
* Areas where you need clarification
* Other habits, preferences, or details that you think your partner should consider adding to their user manual
* What surprised you about your partner’s user manual

Each pair should last \~7 minutes.

Continue to pair up for feedback round-robin style until each person has shared with each of their teammates.

{{% callout `Pro Tip` %}} When new hires start, add this as a task in their 90-day plan. {{% /callout %}}

## Step 3

### Rinse and repeat

Teams will grow and change so as new team members join your poject or team, have them fill it out and share in you next team meeting!

{{% callout `Virtual Tip` %}} Zoom breakout feature is a great way to run this with large groups, by breaking groups up and switching people in groups. Will require multiple presentations, but people are more likely to talk together and this will breed deeper connections {{% /callout %}}

## Variations

### Go Deeper

Consider adding more prompts to your user manuals:

* I feel that my purpose here is to
* I feel energized and engaged when
* I struggle to focus and stay motivated when
* To make me feel like I matter, please
* I'd really prefer if you would be willing to avoid
* Right now I'm working on
* When you have positive feedback for me, I'd prefer you
* When you have something constructive for me, I'd like if you could

### Make it part of your standup

Incorporate these as quick get-to-know each other exercises in your standing meetings by spending 5 min at the beginning of each meeting on one topic/question and running through everyone's answer.

### Gamify It!

Try a gamification version of this play. Collect and anonymize the team slides from one prompt and have the team try to guess whose slide is whose. [nrc-programme-policy-english.pdf](/uploads/nrc-programme-policy-english.pdf "nrc-programme-policy-english.pdf")
