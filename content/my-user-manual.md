# Running the play

Download the starter deck and review what questions you'd like to ask of yourself and of your teammates. Agree on which ones to focus on.

## Step 1

### Spend time before you meet answering each of the prompts (30 mins)

We've provided 10 prompts in the deck, but here's a sample of what you'll find:

* Conditions I like to work in
* Best ways to communicate with me
* The ways I like to receive feedback
* Things I love
* Favorite saying

## Step 2

### Share your user manuals with each other (5 - 60 mins)

{{% callout "Timing" %}} (Number of Participants - 1) x 7 minutes

A good estimate for timing is to take the number of participants, subtract 1, then multiply by 7 to get the number of participants. So if you have 8 participants, it would be (8-1) x 7 = 49 minutes. {{% /callout %}}(Number of Participants - 1) x 7 minutes.

Pair up into teams of 2 (with one team of 3 if you have an odd number of team members), and take turns sharing feedback on areas such as:

* How you partner’s description of themselves matches up with your experience working with them
* Areas where you need clarification
* Other habits, preferences, or details that you think your partner should consider adding to their user manual
* What surprised you about your partner’s user manual

Each pair should last \~7 minutes.

Continue to pair up for feedback round-robin style until each person has shared with each of their teammates.

{{% callout "Pro Tip" %}} When new hires start, add this as a task in their 90-day plan. {{% /callout %}}

## Step 3

### Rinse and repeat

Teams will grow and change so as new team members join your poject or team, have them fill it out and share in you next team meeting!

{{% callout "Virtual Tip" %}} Zoom breakout feature is a great way to run this with large groups, by breaking groups up and switching people in groups. Will require multiple presentations, but people are more likely to talk together and this will breed deeper connections {{% /callout %}}
