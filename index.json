Agree on which ones to focus on.\nStep 1 Spend time before you meet answering each of the prompts (30 mins) We\u0026rsquo;ve provided 10 prompts in the deck, but here\u0026rsquo;s a sample of what you\u0026rsquo;ll find:\n Conditions I like to work in Best ways to communicate with me The ways I like to receive feedback Things I love Favorite saying  Step 2 Share your user manuals with each other (5 - 60 mins)  Timing A good estimate for timing is the following formula:\n(Number of Participants - 1) x 7 minutes\nSo if you have 8 participants, it would be (8-1) x 7 = 49 minutes.\n  Pair up into teams of 2 (with one team of 3 if you have an odd number of team members), and take turns sharing feedback on areas such as:\n How you partner’s description of themselves matches up with your experience working with them Areas where you need clarification Other habits, preferences, or details that you think your partner should consider adding to their user manual What surprised you about your partner’s user manual  Each pair should last ~7 minutes.\nContinue to pair up for feedback round-robin style until each person has shared with each of their teammates.\n Pro Tip When new hires start, add this as a task in their 90-day plan.
